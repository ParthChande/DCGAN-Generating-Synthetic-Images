# **DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network)**

DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network) is a type of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that uses convolutional layers to generate synthetic images. It consists of two main components: a Generator and a Discriminator, which are trained together in a competitive process. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how DCGAN works to generate synthetic images:

# Components of DCGAN

1. Generator:
   - The Generator is responsible for creating synthetic images from random noise.
   - It takes a random noise vector (input) and applies a series of fractionally-strided convolutional layers (also known as deconvolutional layers) to upsample the noise into an image.
   - The Generator's goal is to produce images that are indistinguishable from real images.
