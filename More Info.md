# **DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network)**

DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network) is a type of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that uses convolutional layers to generate synthetic images. It consists of two main components: a Generator and a Discriminator, which are trained together in a competitive process. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how DCGAN works to generate synthetic images:
